# DradelResultModeling
A model of the game dradel, this is used to show the total number of coins for each player during the course of the game

Currently there are two versions in place, the base version of the game (unfair in favour of player 1) and a version where the starting player each round changes and the rounds end with the starting player getting an extra roll

Dependencies:
	Python3
	Numpy
	MatPlotLib
